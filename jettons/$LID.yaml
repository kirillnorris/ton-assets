  We are going to create an application - quite simple, for the activity in which part of the coins will be paid. The essence of the application is as follows: Like/Dislike on certain products/brands/gifts, and if the user guesses, according to the results of the end of the voting, the version of the picture that has gained great community support - he receives several L&D on the balance. How it will work and what is useful for investors:

Attracting liquidity to the project (well, let's say there are two pictures to choose from: BMW and Mercedes and according to the voting results, BMW wins, conditionally. BMW pays some percentage in the form of advertising, this money goes to the development of the project and pay for community activity. It is unlikely that BMW will be interested today, but in the future - why not? (Cola/pepsi/good, sber/t-bank, isn't it enough).

What about gem gifts in Telegram? Technically, this is a reflection of the desire of society to purchase some kind of gift, expressed without the need for financing, this will allow to predict the increase or fall of the cost of gifts in the telegram and in general many, many other opportunities. Would you pay a couple of L&Ds for the opportunity to find out the result a little earlier?

This approach can show the desire of the audience, which is not yet ready to vote in rubles/ton/usdt. Maybe not everyone (conditionally schoolchildren) can now buy an NFC figure of Pavel Durov, but what if you ask what you like more: a Durov figure, a mask that came out on Halloween or a coffin? This will help to predict the cost of gifts even before they are released. Investors and sponsors will be able to see the process in dynamics until the end of voting.

What about the next elections in the United States? Huge momentum there was stakes on the victory/defeat of the same Trump. How much will they pay for the opinion of millions before the announcement of the results. And this is not just an opinion, but a conscious choice motivated by obtaining L&D/usdt.. money, in general, because who will make an unconscious choice if they pay for a conscious one..
